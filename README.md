## Key Skills Learned

- Access a database from a language like Python by using the appropriate API. Examples include ibm_db API for IBM DB2, psycopg2 for ProstgreSQL, and dblib API for SQL Server.

- DB-API is Python's standard API for accessing relational databases. It allows you to write a single program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases instead of writing a separate program for each one.

- The DB_API connect constructor creates a connection to the database and returns a Connection Object, which is then used by the various connection methods.
